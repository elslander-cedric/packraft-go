# packraft-go: project instructions

Route-planning app for packrafting (mixed hike + paddle trips).

## Stack
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, deployed to Vercel Hobby (ADR 0015). Browser-only logic in v1: no API routes, no database (ADR 0011).
- Map: Leaflet with OpenTopoMap tiles. Map components must be client-only (Leaflet needs `window`).
- Routing/snapping/elevation: public BRouter server, hiking profile for hike legs and river profile for paddle legs (ADR 0014). Only route a leg when it changes; store results in the trip.
- Storage: browser storage + file save/open (ADR 0011).
- Tests: Vitest (unit), Playwright (end-to-end), recorded BRouter responses, never the live server (ADR 0019).
- Free services only (ADR 0012). English UI with strings in one module (ADR 0013).

## Commands
_To be filled in once the stack is chosen (install, test, lint, run)._

## Conventions
- Domain terms are defined in `GLOSSARY.md`; use them consistently in code and docs.
- Significant decisions get an ADR in `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`.
- Work is tracked as GitHub issues; labels: `ready-for-agent`, `tested`, `needs-fix`.
- Never push to `main` directly; open a PR.
